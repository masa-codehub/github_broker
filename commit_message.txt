feat: Refactor TaskService to use Redis cache for issue retrieval

This commit refactors the TaskService to utilize the Redis cache for retrieving issue information,
improving performance and reducing reliance on direct GitHub API calls.

- Modified `TaskService.complete_previous_task` to fetch issues from Redis cache.
- Updated `tests/application/test_task_service.py` to reflect the changes in `TaskService`
  and ensure all tests pass with the new Redis-based logic.
- Removed outdated test `test_request_task_no_open_issues`.
