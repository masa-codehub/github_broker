feat: Redesign prompt architecture and update documentation

This commit addresses the architectural inconsistency where the server was generating shell command strings instead of natural language prompts for LLMs.

The `github_broker`'s role is redefined as an orchestrator that generates natural language prompts for AI agents.

Changes include:
- Updated `docs/architecture/system_context.md` to reflect the new architecture, specifically in the system context diagram and API specification for prompt delivery.
- Updated `docs/architecture/code-overview.md` to clarify the roles of `TaskService`, `GeminiClient`, and `GeminiExecutor` in the new prompt generation flow.
- Modified `github_broker/infrastructure/prompts/gemini_executor.yml` to be a natural language prompt template.
- Refactored `github_broker/infrastructure/executors/gemini_executor.py` to remove `shlex.quote` as it's no longer needed for natural language prompts.
- Refactored `github_broker/infrastructure/gemini_client.py` to remove prompt building logic and accept a pre-built prompt from `GeminiExecutor`.
